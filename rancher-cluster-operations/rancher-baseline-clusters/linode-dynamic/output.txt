Warning: Value for undeclared variable

The root module does not declare a variable named "roles_per_pool" but a value was found in file
"terraform.tfvars". If you meant to use this value, add a "variable" block to the configuration.

To silence these warnings, use TF_VAR_... environment variables to provide certain "global" settings
to all configurations in your organization. To reduce the verbosity of these warnings, use the
-compact-warnings option.

Warning: Backend configuration ignored

  on ../../bulk-components/main.tf line 14, in terraform:
  14:   backend "local" {

Any selected backend applies to the entire configuration, so Terraform expects provider configurations
only in the root module.

This is a warning rather than an error because it's sometimes convenient to temporarily call a root
module as a child module for testing purposes, but this backend configuration block will have no
effect.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
